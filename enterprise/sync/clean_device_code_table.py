"""
Cleanup script for device code table.

This script removes expired device codes from the database. Device codes are considered 
expired if they are past their expires_at time.

The cleanup is limited to a maximum number of codes to avoid overwhelming the database.

Usage:
    python sync/clean_device_code_table.py

This script should be run periodically (e.g., via cron job) to maintain database hygiene.
